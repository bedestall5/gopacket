#summary Important changes in gopacket.

=gopacket Change Log=

<wiki:toc/>

==Overview==

This changelog is meant to provide a history of the high (and low) points of the
gopacket library.  We won't put things into it for every change that's
submitted, but it will hightlight some of the particulary interesting or
largescale changes made along the way.  Also, importantly, every change which
could cause backwards incompatibility will be documented here.

If you're adding a change here, please use the already-established style for
doing so.  Major changes or additions should also be announced at the
gopacket@googlegroups.com mailing list.

==Changes==

===v1.0.5 20140121 Fix pcap/pfring timestamps.===

We were incorrectly treating timestamps coming from pfring and pcap as nanoseconds, when they were in fact microseconds.  Thanks to Peter Membrey for pointing this out.

===v1.0.4 20131220 SYN scanning example, simple routing table.===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=181aef30c2f5c0488c81cdfbab97fed70e7625ab

Added a SYN scanner.  Due to needing to send data off the local network, I also had to do
some routing, so I created a very simplistic router using the routing table provided by
netlink.  This router is very untested so far, but it should allow simple network
utilities to send packets pretty easily.

===v1.0.3 20131220 Write/Fix/Move example code===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=26e14693245d21d9dfb69381803f373a44dcbab6

Wrote arp scanning example to show basic packet generation and sending.  Fixed tcp assembly
example to not hang forever.  Moved all example binaries into examples subdirectory.

===v1.0.2 20131202 Serialization bugfixes for IPv4/TCP===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=e28112142a483f757bbc2c13e22cbbd7bd29fa13

Fixes FixLengths in gopacket to correctly set tcp.DataOffset and ip4.IHL.

===v1.0.1 20131004 More serialization, MPLS bugfix===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=96888560c968dd5b5b3b1e2212147792e25769bf

Adds serialization for ARP, EAP, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, MPLS, PPP, and PPPoE.
Fixes bug in MPLS where wrong bit was being used for bottom-of-stack.

===v1.0.0 20131004 Semantic Versioning===

Added semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) to gopacket, for easier go
dependency management.  Starting at v1.0.0 since the current API is
relatively stable and usable, and I don't want anyone scared away by
a v0 version number.

===20131003 Packet serialization.===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=63984d308e5f90225599c32dffd885c5c3d49aba

Adds the ability to create packet data from layer structs.

===20130930 Add DecodingLayer implementation to numerous layers===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=c3135e34b82b6439303aa44b0f92d047f877fb70

Add DecodingLayer capabilities to ARP, Dot1Q, EAP, EAPOL, EtherIP, GRE, ICMPv6,
and IGMP.

===20130930 zero-copy capabilities for *pcap*===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=18af9281fcf4d396d4fe3767ad1413f28c242d9e

Adds the ability to use *pcap* subpackage without copying packet data from C to
Go, saving a full copy of all data.  Benchmarks against live traffic have shown
a 2x increase in the throughput processable by a single core.

===20130917 IGMP support===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=1c9fcb5b211d2b721ace744a410103c4eef69233

===20130821 AF_PACKET support===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=3a810335f15ad55ba4b6cdf76181c5bbbade5df3

===20130722 BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Moved valid mac prefixes into subpackage===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=27312f15fcf8cd261a3bd576263ec587d4a19a20
Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=43cd11eec5c6f690e73420d534e3605c2076f7d7

In order to speed up compiles, the map of valid MAC addresses was moved into a
subpackage.

Adds support for linux AF_PACKET into the *afpacket* subpackage.

===20130711 Fix build breakage on Windows===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=6a82289fba56b8628388b8a57398da587859e3e9

===20130618 TCP Reassembly===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=119d4fcbfd8aa12f449ac44ec3e54c92b0ede64b

Added the *tcpassembly* subpackage to quickly reassemble TCP streams for
sniffing applications.  Along with reassembling streams, this new subpackage
also has some logic to provide those streams as an io.Reader interface, allowing
callers to make use of existing standard library implementations (net/http) for
stream processing.

===20130611 Decoding Known Packet Stacks===

Commit:
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=1688462e35ceda1b5914434bd1add89190c0526e

Allowed users to decode a known layer stack from packet data with zero
memory allocations, creating a much faster packet processing framework.
10x speed up for simple packet stacks (eth/ip/tcp/payload).

===20130522 Lots of work on LLDP, NortelDiscovery, and CDP contributed by
bdaglish@restorepoint.com===

Lots of commits for this one, but everything was fully committed as of
https://code.google.com/p/gopacket/source/detail?r=45d548af72767a6401fa3f928704c236461fffcd

===20130128 Fixes to support winpcap===

Commit:
